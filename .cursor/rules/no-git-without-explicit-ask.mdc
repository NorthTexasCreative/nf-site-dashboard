# Git safety: explicit user request required

- Do **not** run any of the following unless the user **explicitly asks**:
  - `git commit` (including `--amend`)
  - `git push` (any flags)
  - any PR creation flow (e.g. `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, etc.)

- If the user requests code changes but does not explicitly request a commit/push/PR:
  - Make the changes locally only.
  - Stop before any commit/push/PR step and ask for explicit permission.

- If the user explicitly requests a commit/push/PR:
  - Follow the repo’s git safety protocol and avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
